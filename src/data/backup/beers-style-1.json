Due to the positive reaction it received and thinking how ideal it would be as a summer tipple, Head Brewer Cormac O\u2019Dwyer decided to release a bottled version as the \u2018Brewer\u2019s Select\u2019 summer beer for 2012.\r\nTraditionally, English bitters are made with the very hard water profile which occurs at Burton-on-Trent, the home of brewing in England. In West Waterford, the hard water profile means flavours of the English bitter style can be replicated. Coupled with this, the beer is hopped solely with Challenger hops, an English hop used in many traditional bitters.
